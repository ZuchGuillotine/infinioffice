## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Tests**
```bash
# Test individual services
npm test stt.test.js
npm test llm.test.js
npm test tts.test.js
npm test stateMachine.test.js
npm test telephony.test.js
```

### **Integration Tests**
```bash
# Test complete pipeline
npm test voicePipeline.test.js
```

### **End-to-End Tests**
```bash
# Test with real audio files
npm test e2e/
```

### **Performance Tests**
```bash
# Test pipeline performance
npm test performance/
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Audio Pipeline Flow**
1. **Twilio Media Stream** ‚Üí WebSocket connection
2. **Audio Chunks** ‚Üí Deepgram STT (real-time)
3. **Transcription** ‚Üí LLM processing (intent detection)
4. **LLM Response** ‚Üí State machine transition
5. **State Response** ‚Üí Deepgram TTS
6. **Audio Response** ‚Üí Twilio WebSocket

### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **STT Failure**: Retry with exponential backoff, fallback to DTMF
- **LLM Failure**: Use cached responses, fallback to scripted responses
- **TTS Failure**: Use text-to-speech fallback, SMS confirmation
- **Network Failure**: Graceful degradation, voicemail fallback

### **Performance Targets**
- **STT Latency**: <500ms for first partial
- **LLM Latency**: <600ms average
- **TTS Latency**: <300ms for first audio
- **Total Pipeline**: <1.5s end-to-end
